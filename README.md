\- 📍 GPS Location Tracking  

&nbsp; Captures latitude, longitude, and timestamp during attendance.



\- 🔐 Secure Authentication  

&nbsp; User authentication with backend APIs and role-based access.



\- 📊 Admin Monitoring  

&nbsp; Attendance records viewable with photo, location, and date filters.



\- 🗂 Centralized Data Storage  

&nbsp; Secure and scalable database design for long-term usage.

\## 🧠 System Workflow



1\. User logs into the mobile application  

2\. Application checks GPS location against predefined geo-fence  

3\. If location is valid:  

&nbsp;  - Live photo is captured  

&nbsp;  - Attendance is marked with user ID, timestamp, GPS coordinates, and image  

4\. Backend validates and stores attendance data  

5\. Admin can view attendance records and reports
